This script sends automatically an SMS using twidge:
-when someone is bruteforcing your PC, using auth log login failure notification
-when someone has connected to your server, using UFW log and a user predefined port in the script;
-the load past 15 minutes is higher than a set value.
You must have twidge installed on your machine.

For how to install and configure twidge check the following link:

You have to add the script to crontab. I recommend running it every 5 minutes.
